## Introduction to the First Practical Excercise

Welcome to our first practical exercise, where you will need to implement a few basic functions and principles of neural networks in Python. You are going to need to solve the following tasks:

 1. Implement the SGD optimizer
 2. Implement a Fully Connected layer
 3. Implement the Mean Squared Error Loss function
 4. Implement the ReLU activation function
 5. *(optional/Bonus)* Implement the Adam optimizer
